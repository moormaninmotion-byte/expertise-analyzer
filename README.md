# Expertise Analyzer

Welcome to the Expertise Analyzer! This is an interactive web application designed to help you test and deepen your knowledge on any topic.

## How It Works

1.  **Enter a Topic:** Simply provide any subject you want to explore, from "Quantum Physics" to "Renaissance Art" or "JavaScript Promises".
2.  **Generate a Workbook:** The application uses the Google Gemini API to generate a custom, interactive workbook containing five problems.
3.  **Progressive Difficulty:** The problems are carefully crafted to increase in difficulty, starting from a beginner level and progressing to an expert challenge, allowing you to gauge your expertise across different levels.
4.  **Solve and Submit:** Work through each problem in the provided text area.
5.  **Get Expert Feedback:** Once you've written your answer, click "Get Expert Analysis". The AI, acting as a specialist in the field, will provide a detailed, constructive critique of your submission, highlighting your strengths and areas for improvement.

## Technology Stack

This project is built with a modern, efficient technology stack:

*   **Frontend:** [React](https://react.dev/) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for a robust and type-safe user interface.
*   **Styling:** [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for rapid, utility-first UI development.
*   **AI Engine:** The [Google Gemini API](https://ai.google.dev/) (`@google/genai`) powers the workbook generation and the expert analysis of user answers.
